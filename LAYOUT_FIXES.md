# Layout and Scrolling Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Horizontal Scrollbar Issue

**Problem**: The webpage was showing horizontal scrollbars due to using `100vw` width which can cause overflow.

**Solution**:

- Changed `.book-container` width from `100vw` to `100%` with `max-width: 100vw`
- Added `overflow-x: hidden` to `html`, `body`, and `#app` in main.css
- Added responsive width controls with `max-width: 100%` throughout the layout
- Added `overflow: hidden` to the main app container and book wrapper

### 2. Auto Page Navigation Issue

**Problem**: Pages were automatically advancing when users scrolled to 95% of the content, preventing users from fully reading the content.

**Solution**:

- **Removed auto-advance functionality** from the `handleScroll` function
- The scroll indicator now only shows when near the bottom, but doesn't automatically navigate
- Users must now manually navigate using:
  - Navigation buttons
  - Swipe gestures (more restrictive now)
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Click on the "Next Page" indicator

### 3. Improved Swipe Gesture Recognition

**Problem**: Swipe gestures were too sensitive and could interfere with normal scrolling.

**Solution**:

- Increased swipe threshold from 50px to 80px
- Increased velocity threshold from 0.3 to 0.5
- Added stricter validation requiring horizontal movement to be at least 2x more than vertical
- Increased debounce time from 300ms to 500ms
- Only prevent default scrolling when horizontal swipe is much more dominant (2.5x ratio)

### 4. Enhanced Page Content Layout

**Problem**: Page content could overflow and wasn't properly contained.

**Solution**:

- Updated all page components to use proper flex layouts with `overflow-hidden`
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to headers to prevent them from shrinking
- Made content areas scrollable with `overflow-y: auto` and `overflow-x: hidden`
- Added smooth scrolling with `scroll-behavior: smooth` and `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`

### 5. Improved Scroll Indicator

**Problem**: The scroll-to-next indicator wasn't visible enough.

**Solution**:

- Added prominent styling with blue gradient background
- Added pulsing glow animation
- Added hover effects with transform and enhanced glow
- Made it sticky positioned for better visibility
- Added clear "Next Page" text with arrow icon

### 6. Mouse Wheel Navigation Changes

**Problem**: Mouse wheel was automatically changing pages, interfering with content scrolling.

**Solution**:

- Changed mouse wheel navigation to only work with `Ctrl+wheel` combination
- This allows normal scrolling within page content while preserving manual navigation option
